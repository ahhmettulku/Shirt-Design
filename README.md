# Shirt-Design-App
## Description

Shirt Design App is a web application built using React that allows users to design and customize their own shirts. It leverages the power of Three.js for interactive animations and provides a seamless user experience.

The app also includes a Node.js backend server that facilitates requests to Dall-E, an image generation model, enabling users to visualize their custom shirt designs in real-time. Users can either upload their own images or create images using Dall-E.

- Upload or create custom images using Dall-E
- Place custom images as a whole on the shirt or use them as small icons centered on the t-shirt
